## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#6495ED), evokes focus and productivity; it must be bright enough to contrast the background.
- Background color: Light grey (#E5E8E8), same hue as primary but desaturated and light to support longer periods of use and legibility. Provides a clean base to the UI, and serves as the foundation for the other visual elements.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA), an analogous color used to give a sense of focus without being too distracting. Provides delightful accents to key UI elements without pulling too much attention.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headers and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Simple, minimalist icons that are contextually relevant and aesthetically pleasing. All icons should maintain consistent line weight.
- Subtle animations and audio cues triggered upon task completion and schedule changes. Dynamic UI changes to adapt to the time of day, using gradients.
